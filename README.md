Hi I am Victoria Mowbray and this is my cli project made with the api that is called and "anapiof fireandice." This api is based on the books of George R. R. Martin, author of the famous "A Game of Thrones", in this api I'm am giving you a chance too look at the house names, coat of arms, and what region they are located. Of course there is much much more information in the api, but I'm just grabbing a small amount. 

There is not install instruction for my part but if you would like there is a gem that is related to this exact api that you can install gem 'game_of_thrones_api', then run bundle Or you can just run gem install game_of_thrones_api.
